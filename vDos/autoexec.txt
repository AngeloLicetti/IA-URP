rem This is essentially the DOS autoexec.bat.
rem =========================================

rem At startup, C: is the only drive letter known by vDos.
rem But this vDos C: is NOT Windows C: !!!

rem vDos drive letters don't have to match those of Windows.
rem It's even adviced they don't, to limit access to the Windows file system.

rem The USE command assigns vDos drive letters to Windows drives, folders,
rem or network shares. The command syntax is:
rem USE <vDos drive letter:> <Windows drive:|folder|network share>\
rem Examples: USE C: D:\dosprog\, USE F: \\server\share\dosprog\.

rem By default C: is assigned to the folder vDos.exe is started from.
rem Call the batch file that launches the DataPerfect demo program:
CALL DPTEST\STARTDP 

@ECHO OFF
rem The demo program was closed, and we return here.
rem Eventually add EXIT to close the vDos window.
