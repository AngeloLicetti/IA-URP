		     New Features in muLISP Version 7.30

    This file summarizes features incorporated into muLISP-90 and muLISP XM
(eXtended Memory) since the muLISP Reference Manual was printed.

1.  The new function KEY-TRANSLATION [char, index] determines the line editing
    routine called when a control key or extended function key is pressed
    while using the muLISP line editor (see Section 5.10.5).  Page 388 in
    Appendix H summarizes the index numbers of each of the line edit routines.

2.  The new function PRINT-SCREEN [row, col] sends an image (text or graphics
    depending on the current video mode) of the current muLISP window (see
    Section 5.8.6) to the system printer.  The print begins <row> rows from
    the top and <col> columns from the left side of the printed page.  The
    printer type (0=plain, 1=HP Laserjet, 2=Epson nine-pin dot-matrix, 3=IBM
    Proprinter, 4=HP Deskjet Color) is stored in the byte at offset 856
    (0358H) in the muLISP base page (see Appendix H).  For example, to specify
    an HP Laserjet printer, issue the command (CSMEMORY 856 1) before issuing
    the PRINT-SCREEN command.

    Printer information used by PRINT-SCREEN (WRITE-SCREEN also uses the
    Orientation byte) is stored starting at offset 928 (03A0H) in the base
    page.  CSMEMORY can be used to change the following data before issuing
    the PRINT-SCREEN command:

    03A0  928	DB	0	;ORIENTATION (0=PORTRAIT, 1=LANDSCAPE)
    03A1  929	DB	0	;COLOR NUMBER (0-15) TO BE DISPLAYED UNIQUELY
    03A2  930	DW	6	;PRINTER LINES PER INCH
    03A4  932	DW	10	;PRINTER CHARACTERS PER INCH

				;DATA FOR LASERJET & DESKJET PRINTERS
    03A6  934	DW	20	;PAGE LENGTH IN HALF INCHES
    03A8  936	DW	16	;PAGE WIDTH IN HALF INCHES
    03AA  938	DW	75	;VERTICAL RESOLUTION IN DPI (75,100,150,300)
    03AC  940	DW	75	;HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION IN DPI (75,100,150,300)

				;DATA FOR DOTMATRIX PRINTERS
    03AE  942	DW	21	;FORM-FEED PAPER PAGE LENGTH IN HALF INCHES
    03B0  944	DW	17	;FORM-FEED PAPER PAGE WIDTH IN HALF INCHES
    03B2  946	DW	60	;VERTICAL RESOLUTION IN DPI
    03B4  948	DW	120/2	;HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION IN DPI

				;DATA FOR IBM PROPRINTERS
    03B6  950	DW	21	;FORM-FEED PAPER PAGE LENGTH IN HALF INCHES
    03B8  952	DW	17	;FORM-FEED PAPER PAGE WIDTH IN HALF INCHES
    03BA  954	DW	180	;VERTICAL RESOLUTION IN DPI
    03BC  956	DW	180	;HORIZONTAL RESOLUTION IN DPI

3.  The new function WRITE-SCREEN [sink] sends a graphics image of the current
    muLISP window to <sink> in uncompressed TIF (Tagged Image Format) file
    format and returns T.  If no <sink> is given, the image is sent to the
    standard output sink (see Section 5.8.4).  If in a text rather than a
    graphics video mode (see Appendix A), no action is taken and WRITE-SCREEN
    simply returns NIL.

4.  The function VIDEO-MODE (see Section 5.8.6) now supports nonstandard video
    modes (e.g. super VGA) in addition to the video modes listed in Appendix A
    of the manual.  The nonstandard mode must be supported by BIOS Interrupt
    10H functions AH=0 through 0FH and function 1BH.  See the manual of your
    graphics adapter card to determine the video modes properly supported by
    Interrupt 10H.

5.  If the second argument of the function VIDEO-MODE is nonNIL and the
    computer has EGA or VGA graphics capability, an 8x8 text character
    generator is used instead of the standard 8x16 (VGA) or 8x14 (EGA)
    character generator.  This doubles or almost doubles the rows of text
    that can be displayed on the screen.

6.  Loading the file STATS.LSP displays the current size of the various
    muLISP data spaces in bytes.  It should normally be loaded just after
    issuing a SAVE or RECLAIM command.

7.  After using the muLISP editor's or debugger's Options Display command to
    change the display mode (see Chapter 7), pressing the F5 function key
    switches back to the previous display mode.

8.  In the text video modes (1, 2, 3, and 4), characters displayed on the
    screen normally blink if the background is set between 8 and 15 inclusive
    (see Appendix B).  EGA and VGA video cards provide the option of disabling
    blinking thus allowing 16 instead of just 8 background colors.  If the new
    control variable *BLINK-DISABLE* defined in WINDOWS.LSP is nonNIL,
    blinking is disabled and 16 background colors are available for windows
    applications.

9.  The new static Source Code Analyzer included with muLISP provides a
    mechanism to debug, document, and organize application programs.  See
    Chapter 1 of the muLISP Reference Manual Supplement for details.

10. The muLISP CLOS source file library provide the essential capabilities of
    the Common LISP Object System including classes, instances, generic
    functions, and methods.  See Chapter 2 of the muLISP Reference Manual
    Supplement for details.

11. The RAMCRAM.COM utility program for batch file processing is described
    in the text file RAMCRAM.DOC.  The batch file EXAMPLE.BAT is an example
    of its use.

12. muLISP-90 supports the HP 95LX palmtop computer.  muLISP XM will NOT run
    on this computer.  muLISP-90 includes the following HP 95LX support:

    a.	muLISP recognizes the computer's 240x128 graphics video mode 32.

    b.	muLISP conserves battery power by initiating "light sleep" when waiting
	for keyboard input.

    c.	The file HP95LX.LSP defines utility functions for detecting the HP
	95LX computer, and for turning on and off the computer's serial port
	to conserve battery power when not sending data to the serial port.

    d.	The terminate-and-stay-resident program HP95CHAR.COM loads the standard
	IBM 437 extended ASCII character set generator appropriate for the
	HP 95LX computer's graphics video mode 32.  To display extended ASCII
	characters (i.e. those above 127), run HP95CHAR before running muLISP.

    e.	When run on a desktop computer, the terminate-and-stay-resident program
	FORWARD.COM forwards the serial data sent by an HP 95LX to a printer
	with a parallel port.  To use FORWARD.COM, do the following:

	1)  Connect the cable supplied with the HP Connectivity Pack to the
	    HP 95LX and the COM1 serial port on a desktop computer.

	2)  Connect the printer to the LPT1 parallel port on the desktop
	    computer.

	3)  On the desktop computer, issue the MS-DOS command
				MODE LPT1:
	    to direct printer output to the parallel port.

	4)  On the desktop computer, issue the MS-DOS command
			  FORWARD COM1:9600 LPT1
	    so data received from COM1 at 9600 baud is forwarded to LPT1.

	5)  On the HP 95LX, use the system manager to set the baud rate to 9600.

	6)  On the HP 95LX running muLISP, send text to the printer by opening
	    for output a file with the device name 'PRN.

13. muLISP-90 supports the NEC PC-9801 series of computers popular in Japan.
    muLISP XM will NOT run on these computers.	The utility file NECGRAPH.LSP
    included with muLISP-90 defines the following PC-9801 graphics functions:

	GRAPHICS-INIT			GRAPHICS-SCREEN
	GRAPHICS-WINDOW 		GRAPHICS-COLOR
	GRAPHICS-CLS			GRAPHICS-PLOT-DOT
	GRAPHICS-PLOT-LINE		GRAPHICS-PLOT-BOX
	GRAPHICS-PLOT-CIRCLE		GRAPHICS-READ-DOT

14. Support is provided for writing network applications in muLISP:
    a.	When a file is opened, bits 4-6 of the byte at offset 017Eh (=382d) in
	the muLISP basepage determine the files share mode (000=compatible,
	001=read/write access denied, 010=write access denied, 011=read access
	denied, 100=full access permitted).  Also if bit 7 of this byte is set,
	the file is not inherited by any child process.
    b.	When a file is opened, if bit 5 of the byte at offset 017Fh (=383d) is
	set, the interrupt 24h error handler is not used to handle file errors.
	If by 6 of this byte is set, the file is updated immediately after
	each write.
    c.	The functions INPUT-FILE-P and OUTPUT-FILE-P return the MS-DOS file
	handle for the file (i.e. a number between 0 and 65535 inclusive).
