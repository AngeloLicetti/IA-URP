		  The RAMCRAM.COM Utility Program

     The RAMCRAM.COM utility program is for use with MS-DOS batch
files, such as AUTOEXEC.BAT.  RAMCRAM is copyrighted in 1991 by Soft
Warehouse, Inc. and may not copied or distributed without the
express written permission of Soft Warehouse, Inc.

     The RAMCRAM utility program performs the following services for
batch file processing.	The first two services are only for use on
the HP 95LX computer.  The third service can be used on any PC
compatible computer.  The last two services can be used on any MS-
DOS computer.

RAMCRAM A xxxx y  --  increases the space available for running an
     MS-DOS program.  First it reduces the amount of free drive C
     RAM disk memory to  y  8K blocks.	Next it performs the warm
     reboot of the HP 95LX computer that is required after resizing
     RAM disk memory.  Finally if there are at least  xxxx
     paragraphs (i.e. 16*xxxx bytes) of RAM memory available for
     running the MS-DOS program, it returns an exit code of 0;
     otherwise it returns an exit code of 1.  This exit code can be
     used by  IF ERRORLEVEL  commands in a batch file to determine
     if there is sufficient memory to run the MS-DOS program.  Both
     y and xxxx should be hexadecimal numbers.

RAMCRAM B  --  restores the drive C RAM disk to its original size
     and performs the necessary reboot of the computer.  This
     command should be done in a batch file just before returning
     control to the HP 95LX system manager.  (The MS-DOS command
     $SYSMGR returns control to the system manager.)

RAMCRAM C n  --  if n is a number in hexadecimal number less than
     256, sets the video mode to n.  Otherwise, it returns an exit
     code equal to the current video mode.

RAMCRAM D  --  displays the number of kilobytes of system RAM
     available for running DOS application programs.

RAMCRAM E  --  if running on an HP 95LX computer, it returns an exit
     code of 0.  Otherwise, it returns an exit code of 1.

RAMCRAM n  --  where n is a digit between 1 and 9 inclusive,
     displays the message "Enter number of desired option:" and
     waits for the user to press a number between 1 and n inclusive.
     It returns the number pressed as an exit code.  This exit code
     can be used by  IF ERRORLEVEL  commands in a batch file.

     The batch file EXAMPLE.BAT included on the muLISP distribution
diskette provides examples of the use of the RAMCRAM utility program.
