rem vDos has some configuration options, you set them in this file.
rem Don't try to include DOS config.sys or Windows 32-bit config.nt settings like FILES= or KEYB=, that won't work!

rem <value>: 	A numeric value or string.
rem [value]:	Parameter is optional.
rem val1|val2:	Supply one (no |).


REM Memory
REM ======
rem 8MB XMS memory is provided. If your program supports more, or a different type of memory:
rem XMEM = [+]<MB> XMS|EMS|EXT
rem MB is 1-63. The optional plus sign appends the first 64KB of the graphics adapter to conventional memory.
rem Caution, you can't use graphics if this is set, that will override/destroy this extra memory!


REM Keyboard
REM ========
rem For instance pasting text is done by Win+Ctrl+V. The Win key is required so DOS programs will get and can handle Ctrl+V.
rem If your program has no use for Ctrl+ combinations, and you prefer Ctrl+ without the Win key:
rem WINKEY = OFF
    

REM Mouse
REM =====
rem In text mode the mouse is disabled.
rem Some programs just handle the mouse badly (being able to leave the window), to turn it on:
rem MOUSE = ON


REM Font
REM ====
rem Text is displayed by a built-in scalable TTF font.
rem To use another (monospaced) font, copy the font file (consola.ttf...) to the vDos folder, then:
rem FONT = CONSOLA
rem Or more directly, for Windows installed fonts:
rem FONT = C:\WINDOWS\FONTS\CONSOLA
rem If no file extension is supplied, .TTF is assumed.

rem ASCII codes 176-223 mostly display a mix of lines/boxes and extended characters.
rem If your program displays characters where you expect lines, force these to lines by the optional minus sign:
rem FONT = -[fontname]

rem The Euro symbol isn't displayed by default. Mostly it's ASCII 128, to get that displayed instead of C-cedilla:
rem EURO = 128


REM Window
REM ======
rem The default text mode window is lean and mean. No borders or a title bar.
rem If you prefer the familiar Windows borders and title bar:
rem FRAME = ON

rem The window is centered and will cover about (max) 75% of the screen.
rem This can be changed by WINDOW = [-][max percentage][left-x-pos:top-y-pos]
rem In text mode, the window has some extra blank space to the left and right, the minus sign will disable this.
rem This would give you a full screen view. Mind, it's still a window (in disguise), so it won't obscure any Windows messages:
rem WINDOW = 100
rem Alternatively, you can of course use Alt+Enter to switch to and back from full screen.

rem The number of lines and columns in text mode are the standard DOS 25x80.
rem It can be set differently by LINS = <24+> and COLS = <80+>. 
rem See for yourself if this is useful or supported by your program.
rem LINS = 30
rem COLS = 100

rem To use a different color scheme in text mode, supply all 16 color values in RGB: (r,g,b), or hexadecimal as in HTML: #RRGGBB.
rem The original DOS colors (first line is docu):
rem				0 - Black	1 - Blue	2 - Green 	3 - Aqua 	4 - Red 	5 - Purple	6 - Yellow 	7 - White 	8 - Gray	9 - Lt Blue		10 - Lt Green	11 - Lt Aqua	12 - Lt Red		13- Lt Purple	14 - Lt Yellow	15 - Bright White
rem COLORS =	(0,0,0)		#0000aa		#00aa00		#00aaaa		(170,0,0)	#aa00aa		#aa5500		#aaaaaa		#555555		#(85,85,255)	#55ff55			#55ffff			#ff5555			#ff55ff			#ffff55			#ffffff

rem Select a MDA card with an underline attribute. Mind, this doesn't work for all programs.
rem COLORS = MONO[,color scheme]

rem Scale the window when in graphics mode: SCALE = <1-9> (that’s 100-900%).
rem It won't be that nice, A single point is simply enlarged to 2x2 points:
rem SCALE = 2


REM WordPerfect/WordStar
REM ====================
rem The WP= directive is specific for use of WordPerfect or Wordstar.
rem Documentation can be found at: http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/vdoswp.html or http://sfwriter.com/ws-vdos.htm.


REM Printing
REM ========
rem Without explicit settings, printing should mostly work just fine.
rem If it doesn't, or you want more control over the printer's output: See the Printing.pdf document.
